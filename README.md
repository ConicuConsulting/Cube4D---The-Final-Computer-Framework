**Author**: *Callum Maystone*

**Abstract**:  
Cube4D represents a paradigm shift in data structuring and programming logic, combining graph theory with multidimensional, policy-driven data interactions. This thesis explores Cube4D’s technical foundations, conceptual structure, and real-world applicability. Originating from insights in data architecture and cognitive reasoning, Cube4D enables dynamic data handling by introducing Active Graph Networks (AGN) — a framework designed to optimize complex data relationships through adaptable policy enforcement, rule-based logic, and time-based conditions.

## Background and Motivation

Cube4D was born from a journey through AI model building, healthcare data systems, and an insatiable curiosity for exploring complex relationships in data. This thesis encapsulates that journey, diving into the “how, why, and what” behind Cube4D’s creation. By bridging the gap between abstract reasoning and practical application, Cube4D provides a novel approach to processing logic, policy-driven relationships, and scalable data structures.

## Core Philosophical Foundations

Cube4D operates on fundamental principles of structure, purpose, and adaptability, reflected in three key conceptual axes:

1. **X-Axis (What)**: Represents the core data or information — the essence of stored knowledge within the Cube4D framework.
2. **Y-Axis (Why)**: Reflects relational connections, signifying the purpose behind data interlinking and connectivity.
3. **Z-Axis (How)**: Denotes the logic and policies applied to data, adapting dynamically to external conditions.
4. **Temporal Dimension**: Time-based conditions that further refine how data relationships evolve, making them adaptable to change.

Together, these axes facilitate **Effectus** — the cumulative result of Cube4D’s dynamic interactions, and **Quomodo** — the structured, scalable method Cube4D uses for processing.

## Technical Foundations of Cube4D

### 1. **Multi-dimensional Bit Encoding for Data and Logic**

Cube4D’s binary encoding creates a highly efficient structure for representing each element within the data framework:
   - **Binary Encoding Structure**: Each node, query, or relationship in Cube4D has a distinct binary identifier.
   - **7-Bit and 14-Bit Structures**: These configurations enhance data complexity handling, with additional bits allowing for parity checks and error detection.
   - **Efficiency Scaling with Bits**: This modular design lets the system grow in complexity by simply adding bits, preserving efficiency across increased data layers.

### 2. **Policy-Driven Relationships and Rule-Based Logic**

Cube4D introduces policy-driven relationships where data connections adapt based on contextual parameters. Each relationship type (e.g., influences, processes) can be dynamically modified by:
   - **Policies**: Modifying influence levels based on external factors like time or access requirements.
   - **Rules**: Governing the outcome of tasks under specific conditions, adding a layer of conditional adaptability.

### 3. **Node Types and Interaction Protocols**

The Cube4D framework categorizes nodes into distinct roles that mirror real-world data processing:
   - **Cognitive Nodes (e.g., Pattern Recognition)**: Responsible for tasks related to AI adaptability and recognition.
   - **Knowledge Nodes (e.g., Mathematics, Physics)**: Domain-specific information nodes that contextualize data.
   - **Task and Outcome Nodes (e.g., Problem Solving)**: Execute specific objectives, completing assigned tasks within defined rules.
   - **Policy and Rule Nodes**: Control relationship evolution and enforce the logical outcome.

---

## Dependency Model and Hierarchical Structure

Cube4D is built around a hierarchical structure that employs dependencies to streamline data handling:

### Dependency Index and Cube Referencing
Each Cube4D structure references a **cube_dependency_index** to manage interconnected data. Dependencies are organized across the following levels:
   - **Root Level (T_0)**: The base cube with foundational cognitive, task, and policy nodes.
   - **Child Nodes**: Nodes like knowledge or outcome nodes that derive logic based on T_0 principles.
   - **Cross-Cube Dependencies**: Allows data from other cubes to inform the current cube’s logic, enabling cross-functional intelligence.

**Example**: For cognitive reasoning in healthcare, a task like “Pattern Recognition in Symptoms” may pull in external data to improve prediction accuracy, creating a multi-cube dependency structure.

---

## Programming Logic and Four-Dimensional Design

Cube4D’s design introduces a four-dimensional programming model where each axis represents a unique facet of data interaction:

1. **X-Axis**: Information/data nodes.
2. **Y-Axis**: Relational connections.
3. **Z-Axis**: Logical rules and policies.
4. **Temporal Dimension**: Adapts connections and relationships based on time-sensitive conditions.

This structure lets Cube4D handle complex relationships in real-time, maintaining both a clear hierarchy and adaptive, policy-based processing.

### Example Code and Structure

Below is the Cube4D schema for processing complex data relationships, leveraging policy-driven adaptability:

```json
{
    "T_0": {
        "nodes": {
            "C1": {"type": "Cognitive", "description": "Pattern recognition"},
            "C2": {"type": "Cognitive", "description": "Logical reasoning"},
            "K1": {"type": "Knowledge", "description": "Mathematics"},
            "K2": {"type": "Knowledge", "description": "Physics"},
            "T1": {"type": "Task", "description": "Solve math problem"},
            "O1": {"type": "Outcome", "description": "Solution to math problem"},
            "P1": {"type": "Policy", "description": "Influence based on knowledge level"}
        },
        "relationships": [
            {"source": "C1", "target": "K1", "relationship_type": "influences", "policy": "P1"},
            {"source": "C2", "target": "T1", "relationship_type": "processes", "policy": "P1"}
        ]
    }
}
```

### Example Query Execution with Binary Encoding
Cube4D uses a unique encoding system to streamline queries:

```plaintext
Get-Patient-Record | Where {$_.name -eq First:'Arthur'/Last:'Dent'}
Binary: 1011111.0010010.0000010..0010011.0000110
```

This binary encoding simplifies complex queries by denoting each node, relationship, and condition within a compact sequence.

Here’s the requested mermaid diagram illustrating the relationships within the Cube4D schema:

## Technical Insights and Future Vision

Cube4D and Active Graph Networks (AGN) represent a groundbreaking shift in data processing and logic programming by introducing a four-dimensional, policy-driven framework. By merging the foundational principles of graph theory with a structured, multi-axis approach, Cube4D redefines the standards for real-time adaptability and scalability in data organization.

### Dynamic, Multi-Dimensional Framework for Complex Problem Solving

Cube4D is built upon a multi-axis structure (X, Y, Z, and Temporal) that enables high-dimensional processing. Each axis defines a unique aspect of data interaction:

1. **X-Axis (Core Data)**: The foundation of stored knowledge, representing raw information.
2. **Y-Axis (Relational Dynamics)**: Governs relationships between data, establishing the “why” behind connections.
3. **Z-Axis (Logic and Policies)**: Houses rules and adaptive logic that govern data behavior.
4. **Temporal Dimension**: Introduces time-sensitive conditions, adding flexibility and real-time adaptability to data interactions.

### Encoding and Binary Structure for Optimal Processing

At Cube4D’s core is an efficient binary encoding system, designed to handle complex queries with minimal overhead. This encoding supports flexible scaling:
   - **Bit-Level Encoding**: Data points, relationships, and policies are represented as binary codes, enabling precise identification and faster query execution.
   - **7-Bit and 14-Bit Configurations**: These configurations allow for incremental scaling, with 14-bit adding parity for error-checking and data integrity.
   - **Dynamic Node Classification**: Binary encoding integrates directly with node classification, ensuring that each node type (cognitive, knowledge, task) is efficiently processed based on its binary representation.

### Policy and Rule-Based Adaptability

Policies and rules in Cube4D play a pivotal role, giving the framework dynamic adaptability. Policies govern how relationships evolve, while rules define task outcomes based on specific conditions:
   - **Policy-Driven Influence**: Policies adjust the effect of relationships dynamically, allowing for context-based scaling. For example, a policy may heighten influence when certain data thresholds are met.
   - **Conditional Rules**: Rules adjust task outcomes based on time, data sensitivity, or user roles. This feature provides Cube4D with robust, multi-dimensional logic adaptability, especially useful in complex systems like healthcare or AI.

### Query Example: Multi-Axis Cube4D Search

To visualize Cube4D’s querying process, imagine querying across these axes like looking up coordinates on each Excel sheet. Here’s how an example query could retrieve and manipulate data across Cube4D’s layers:

1. **Query**: Retrieve the "Patient Record" for a user, with constraints applied based on their role and temporal data.
2. **Interpretation across Axes**:
   - **X-Axis (Data)**: Looks up specific patient data.
   - **Y-Axis (Relationship)**: Maps the patient to relevant medical history or relationships (e.g., doctor-patient).
   - **Z-Axis (Logic)**: Applies access control policies based on the requester’s role.
   - **T-Axis (Temporal)**: Ensures the data is current, applying any time-based updates if necessary.
